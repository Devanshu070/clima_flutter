# Clima : A Weather App

## Description
This project is a weather application. It is developed using the Dart programming language, with a focus on asynchronous programming techniques. The app is designed to perform tasks such as retrieving device location and fetching weather data from the internet.

## Key Learnings
- Implemented asynchronous tasks using async/await and Futures.
- Utilized the Dart http package for networking.
- Interfaced with APIs to obtain live weather data.
- Parsed JSON data using the Dart convert package.
- Implemented navigation between screens and passing data using the Navigator.
- Managed exceptions using try/catch/throw constructs.
- Demonstrated understanding of Stateful Widget lifecycle.
- Integrated Geolocator package for obtaining live location data across iOS and Android platforms.
- Utilized TextField Widget for user input.

## Outcome
The project resulted in a fully functional weather application capable of providing live weather data based on device location and user input.
